### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aerton, and I love programming.

I'm currently working at EducAR Immersive Learning, where I do Unity Development, BackEnd Development and Networking for Games.
I also assist on FrontEnd Development.
Here we make XR(Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality) games for education.

I'm currently learning React, Next.js and Mobile Development.
